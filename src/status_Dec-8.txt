What works:
- all the functions (add, remove, lookup) in nginxupdater
- passing tar files and data from controller to deployer
- running apps manually using the tar files

What is broken:(
- when controller tells deployer to run an app, the app doesn't get added to the deployer's hashtable

Todo:
- in nginxupdater: customize the conf file using the actual app name
  * pass an actual appname instead of a shell command to the nginx updater
