# TODO

## Controller

1. Remove deployer when deployer dies

## Nginx

1. Sometimes, when you kill a job, it says "nginx.conf.backup: openFile: resource busy (file is locked)"
2. Load balancing (http://wiki.nginx.org/LoadBalanceExample)

## Misc.

1. Heroku style client-side app deployment (buildpacks, command-line client, compile server, shared file-system with appcontroller, etc....)
